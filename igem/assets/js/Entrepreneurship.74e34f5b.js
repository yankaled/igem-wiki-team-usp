We got a partnership with BioLambda, a biotechnology company, in which its CEO became one of our main consultants in the area of entrepreneurship, teaching us about the mechanisms of company planning, prospecting and flexibility. We also got another key advisor within the innovation consulting firm Emerge, where Lucas Delgado told us more about the business model and regulations for prioritizing the project. Finally, we contacted BioMinas, an entrepreneurship company in biotechnology and life sciences, requesting a partnership. We got an offer of full scholarships in a course on entrepreneurship. This was essential to have a better foundation and direction in the creation of the business plan and professional development of our team </p><p> From that, we were able to assemble a business plan that was divided into two main propositions: commercial area and academic area. In the commercial area, the project would be developed to be associated with a company or start a startup of its own. Throughout our trajectory, several conversations with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, in which we have an important interest in embracing our project. In the academic area, the project would be developed and written with the aim of publishing articles, enabling the opening to new fields of research, with the help of sponsorship from stakeholders. </p><h2>P&amp;G PARTNERSHIP</h2><p> At the beginning of 2021 the opportunity arose to establish a partnership with P&amp;G (Procter &amp; Gamble, American consumer goods giant) thanks to one of the team members, Luiz Lima: he contacted an acquaintance who works at the company in order to start a among many of our science outreach projects - the P&amp;G Roundtables. </p><p> Thus, as the demands of the Scientific and the National Synthetic Biology Olympiad became heavier, Luiz passed the torch to João Honda, who took over the contacts with P&amp;G representatives, the prospection of potential speakers and, also, the sponsorship agreement. </p><p> And what is the reason behind this endeavor? In addition to getting sponsorship to add to our funds and leverage the team&#39;s research, we remain faithful to our commitment to disseminate knowledge to society in a broad manner and in an accessible format. </p><p> Furthermore, the core of the structure of this event was built around a &quot;tripod&quot;: we seek to dialogue between the vertices of the Academy (with the authority in the area covered having been chosen by us) and the Market (whose spokesperson would be chosen by P&amp;G) , with the Team iGEM USP at the other end, incorporating in itself the role of mediator. </p><p> Therefore, it was agreed that we would discuss, at the round tables, the following topics: &quot;diversity&quot; (of sexual orientation, gender and ethnicity), &quot;The Mindset of Innovation&quot; (taking scientific research from the perspective of Brazilian entrepreneurship) and, Last but not least, &quot;Why be yourself in the workforce?&quot; (an approach more linked to human resources, but which is undoubtedly relevant to all areas, especially those who aim to enter the labor market for the first time). </p><p> Thus, we have the distinguished presence of: Lucy Souza, science communicator at Make Science BR and trans activist; Palloma Batista, LGBTQ+ activist for P&quot;&amp;&quot;G; Beatriz Pacheco from Ginkgo Bioworks; Caetano Sabino da Biolambda; Abílio Francisco, Marketing Manager at Always; and Sueli Campos, current Human Resources director at SGS Brasil. </p><p> It is worth remembering that, always striving for the accessibility of our content, we broadcast the tables live through our social networks - Facebook and Instagram - in addition to having posted them on our YouTube channel, in order to record this fun, educating experience and captivating. </p><p> In short, more than an enriching partnership with a colossal player, we have the presence of several distinguished authorities from their respective areas to provide conversations that are both relaxed and informative to the most diverse spectators, even if the focus was initially on the university audience. </p><p> The goal was to be a first step toward a long-term partnership with P&amp;G, as well as a test of our audience reach. Given the very positive feedbacks from our broadcasts and the effervescent engagement of users in them, there&#39;s no doubt: we delivered everything we expected and much more. </p><h2>COMMERCE AND MEDIA</h2><p> Within the project&#39;s business plan, we thought we would need ways to make the project better known and facilitate the search for new prospects. Having said that, we created a plan for the creation of an official website for the iGEM-USP Brazil team, as well as a reformulation and rebirth of our YouTube channel, both serving as services that maintain and act beyond the current project. The official website <a href="https://igemusp.com/">https://igemusp.com/ </a>contains all the description of our project, previous projects, the team, as well as pages for donations and for contacting the team. In it, we also applied our own store building plan. This store would have the objective of maintaining the team as a whole, as well as sustaining the economic future of the Let.It.Bee project post-competition. Therefore, we built a document with all the operation and rules of the store, and signed a business partnership with the jewelry company Pérolla, in which part of the sales profits obtained with the coupon associated with our project would be converted to the team, as well as a partnership with Vivian de Sordi, creator of handcrafted and original jewelry. We got a deal on two sets of 100% original jewelry inspired by our current project made by Vivian. </p><p> The rebirth of our YouTube channel has allowed us to become a center for the dissemination of our projects and as a means of scientific dissemination, with materials prepared by our audiovisual team, with the objective of reaching an ever-wider audience. </p></div><div class="column is-one-fifth"></div></section>',2);function r(e,t,o,r,i,s){var h=Object(a["j"])("Nav"),c=Object(a["j"])("Footer");return Object(a["g"])(),Object(a["b"])("div",null,[Object(a["f"])(h),n,Object(a["f"])(c)])}var i=o("216c"),s=o("fd2d"),h={name:"Description",components:{Nav:i["a"],Footer:s["a"]}},c=o("d959"),p=o.n(c);const l=p()(h,[["render",r]]);var u=l;o("f9d9"),o("f33e"),o("ec45"),o("a073"),o("9291");Object(a["a"])(u).mount("#app")}});
