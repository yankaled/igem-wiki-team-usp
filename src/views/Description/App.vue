        <h2>WHY ARE BEES SO IMPORTANT?</h2>
        <p>
          Despite being small creatures, bees are extremely important for the
          environment and humanity. There are over 20.000 bee species around the
          world, from social to solitary bees, sting bees to stingless bees. In
          Brazil only, there are about 3.000 bee species, the greatest diversity
          of bees in the whole world [1]! All of them serve many ecosystem
          services, including a very important one: <b>plant pollination</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Ecological importance</h3>
        <p>
          hen bees are visiting a plant to collect its pollen and nectar, pollen
          grains from the anthers get stuck to its body so when they next come
          in contact with the stigma (from the same flower or other flowers from
          the same species), fecundation happens [2]. So, by pollinating plants,
          they <b>guarantee the species reproduction</b> as well as
          <b>genetic variability</b>. Because of that, 85% of species that
          compose forests are dependent on this service from different types of
          bees, the most known being the western honey bee (Apis mellifera) the
          most frequent floral visitor [3, 4,11].
        </p>
        <p>
          Bees are the main pollinators, responsible for the preservation of
          many plant species worldwide. In Brazil, a single group of bees (the
          stingless Meliponina) already contributes to the pollination of 40% to
          90% of all tree species,
          <b
            >maintaining the country's native forest and the ecosystems
            biodiversity</b
          >[2,3].
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaking the ecosystem stability, by disturbing ecological
          relationships maintaned by animals and plants influenced by
          pollination, can cause a great domino effect, resulting in the
          disturbance of the environment, as well as compromise the
          <b>oxygen disponibility and water resources</b> by the vegetation
          decrease [1, 12].
        </p>
        <h3>Economic importance</h3>
        <p>
          Among the plants they are responsible for pollinating, there are many
          crops important for economy. About
          <b
            >70% of the plants that are cultivated for human consumption benefit
            from bee pollination</b
          >, whether in quality or quantity of the product [5]. When looking
          into the brazilian scenario only, bees contribute to almost 80% of
          crops! Some of them are even totally dependent on bees: without them,
          <b>some foods just would not be produced anymore</b> or would turn
          into luxury items. [6]
        </p>
        <img src="@//assets/Joao.jpg" />
        <img src="@//assets/Joao.jpg" />
        <p>
          Pollination by bees is required for a healthy increase in agricultural
          productivity, generating a higher amount, as well as fruits with
          better quality and with more seeds [2]. Fruits that do not get
          pollinated receive less resources from the plant, creating deformities
          that cause farmers to throw them away instead of selling them [12].
        </p>
        <p>
          Bees' importance is manifested into a third of all the food we eat, as
          well as other products that depend on agriculture, like the
          <b>fibers for our clothes, biofuel and vegetable oil</b>, and, of
          course, their honey [12]. Without them, our meals would be much bare
          and joyless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the reliance of farmers production on them,
          <b
            >alone they represent 10% of all the agricultural GDP, 100 billion
            USD per year</b
          >
          [1]. This value can also represent the direct loss in economy if they
          were to disappear completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          By ignoring the problem of their disappearance, we not only can expect
          a future environmental collapse, but also a
          <b>economic catastrophe,</b> with less and worse food and a decrease
          in countries' GDP and employment offer.
        </p>
        <h2>WHY ARE BEES DISAPPEARING?</h2>
        <p>
          Although it is common to call the scenario "bees' disappearance", the
          bees are not actually disappearing, they are mostly dying in masses.
          The fact has been noticed since the 1990s and has caused about
          <b>25% of known bee species to be reported missing to this day</b>
          [7].
        </p>
        <img src="@/assets/Joao.jpg" />
        <p>
          Many are the causes for the phenomenon, for instance migration stress,
          drought, diseases, climate change and, especially,
          <b>pesticides</b> are some of the interferences [7]. Depending on the
          type of situation it can be attributed to different occurences, the
          most important ones being: extinction by habitat loss, Colony Collapse
          Disorder (CCD) and acute intoxication.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very important factor associated with the loss of biodiversity is
          the changes in land use, which has resulted in <b>habitat loss.</b> A
          crucial example is the evergrowing advance of urban areas towards
          native forests [5], a reflection of the search for productivity in
          agricultural activities, that results in malnutrition by low forage
          availability[14].
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, CCD and acute intoxication have been receiving a lot of
          attention because of their meaningful participation and their relation
          to the misuse of pesticides, especially the
          <b>neonicotinoid class</b> [13].
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically for social managed bee species like Apis mellifera, the
          phenomenon has been called <b>Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)</b>,
          which, among multifactorial causes that are still under study, has
          been highly attributed to the use of pesticides. It has been reported
          especially in the <b>United States</b>, where at least 30% of colonies
          were lost by successive deaths between 2006 and 2010, and in some
          countries of <b>Europe</b>. In CCD, some symptons are observed: rapid
          loss of worker bees, increase in the ratio of offsprings to adults,
          absense of offsprings, dead adult bees and avoidance of hive invasion
          by pests [5]. The interaction of pesticides have been proposed to
          <b>potentialize the symptons</b> of pathogenic agents, contributing to
          the syndrome by making the colony more vulnerable [17].
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, in Brazil and many other countries, although there are studies
          over possible cases of CCD none of them are corroborated. Brazilian
          bees' deaths are very associated to <b>acute intoxication</b> by
          pesticides, usually in lethal concentrations. Despite that,
          <b>sublethal concentrations</b> of pesticide directly affects one bee
          individual, evidence shows that this
          <b>detrimental effect cascades</b> over to the whole colony.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall loss of resource diversity associated with landscape
          simplification, in combination with the debilitating effect of
          pesticides of bee species has facilitated for disease to be more
          common within the colony [5]. Brazil is recognized as a great
          pesticide consumer worldwide [5] and, as we can see, those substances
          are main actors in the disappearance of bees and, accordingly, in the
          unbalance of environment and economy. About three quarters of all
          honey contains traces of those toxic compounds [16]. A specific class
          of pesticides has been highly associated with the situation: the
          <b>neonicotinoid class.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>The pesticide: Imidacloprid</h3>
        <img src="@/assets/Figure1Imida.jpg" />
        <p>
          The neonicotinoids are the <b>most widely used </b> class of
          pesticides in the whole world, even after being restricted in the
          European Union [17]. They are neurotoxins very
          <b>selective to insects</b> over vertebrates, competitively targeting
          their <b>nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)</b> in neurons, as
          agonists. The most used one is the <b>Imidacloprid</b>, due to its
          high efficacy and systemic activity in plants, its
          <b>residues are the most found in fruits and vegetables in Brazil </b
          >[15, 18]. Ever since the beginning of the reports of the bees'
          disappearance, Imidacloprid has been highly associated to the
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is usually <b>applied to the seed</b>, spreading through the
          plant's system as it grows and, in this process,
          <b>reaches the flowers</b>, too [19]. Because of pollination, bees
          <b
            >come in contact with the toxic substance by that structure, through
            pollen and nectar</b
          >, by ingesting or touching it. Nectar provide them with
          carbohydrates, serving as an energy source, and the pollen is a
          crucial source of proteins and fats. For that reason, bees take the
          pollen and nectar they collect back to their hive to be stored,
          processed and consumed by other bees [20]. Thus, if the nectar and
          pollen is contaminated by the pesticide,
          <b
            >it can affect not only the bee that collected it, but its entire
            hive!</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          When Imidacloprid enters the bee's system, it can turn into
          metabolites that can be even more toxic, like olefin [21]. Depending
          on its concentration, it can have different (but equally bad) effects
          on the bees. In a high enough concentration, it can kill the bee
          (acute intoxication). But even in sublethal concentrations, which is
          more common to find, <b>imidacloprid can cause chronic toxicity</b>,
          harming them physiologically or behaviorally. It has an
          <b>impact on their motor and cognitive functions</b>, such as
          learning, flying, feeding and navigation memory abilities. This way,
          it also impairs their foraging and, finally, their survival, in a way
          that they often die far away from their own colony [22, 13].
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some overexpressed enzymes from the CYP P450 superfamily have
          been described as participants in the neonicotinoid resistance of some
          insects, converting imidacloprid into less harmful metabolites [15].
          Those enzymes are very important for the development of our project.
        </p>
        <img src="@/assets/Group21.jpg" />
        <p>
          Even though they are marked as contributors to the bee disappearance
          phenomenon, neonicotinoids are very effective pesticides for pest
          control, surpassing many others.
          <b
            >Banning or impairing their function can have a negative effect on
            crops' production and create the need to apply a higher amount of
            other pesticides, a solution that can be even more harmful to the
            environment and also cost more money</b
          >. In short, neonicotinoids are very necessary for agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
          herefore, our solution, <b>Let.it.bee</b>., tries to address the issue
          without cancelling the important pest control effect.
        </p>
        <h2>What is <b>LET.IT.BEE</b></h2>
        <p>
          Due to the recognition to their importance and worries about the
          future, the bee's disappearance problem has been gaining more media
          coverage over the years, which fill us with hope that it will receive
          more solutions like Let.it.bee. Due to the principle of modularity in
          synthetic biology, our project can also easily be adapted to other
          plants and pesticides in the future, by changing the tissue specific
          promoter and, if needed, the enzyme. Thus, after our preliminary tests
          the circuit could be expanded to more crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brazil has suffered a lot from the COVID-19 pandemic, causing many of
          our lab experiments to be delayed. Although our current results and
          modelling are enough to understand more about our project, more tests
          are needed to better improve our circuit. You can check more of this
          journey on the <b>Engineering page.</b>
