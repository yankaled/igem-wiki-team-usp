          Brazil has a huge agricultural history. This sector has a huge role in
          the Brazilian economy, representing 21,4% of Brazilian GDP [5]. Even
          during the COVID pandemic, agribusiness was one of the few sectors
          that continued to grow economically [1]. Producivity is at the center
          of this success, and for that it's extremely important to keep crops
          and safe from pests with better and more effective strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides, during 2019, we saw a lot of news on bee´s disappearance and
          how it could affect the balance of the world. Bees are the world´s
          most important pollinators, being extremely important for the
          maintenance of several ecosystems. A great part of the food we all eat
          exists thanks to bees. Imagine how scarce food would become without
          them, for example.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, in 2020, Brazil´s government allowed the use of many pesticides
          in our country. This made a spark light on us because one of our
          members, shortly after, recalled reading an article about the
          pesticides effects on bees [2]. Well, things could not be different
          and we had to do something about it. Then, almost two years later,
          Let.it.Bee was born.
        </p>

        <h2>Human practices in our project</h2>

        <p>
          Creating a new solution for the bees' disappearance situation was
          tricky. There were a lot of aspects that we had to consider during the
          development of our project. As we were invested in making something
          that would help the scenario as best as possible, we reached out to
          the people that would be affected by our technology and listened to
          them to learn how we could make a real impact in the environment,
          economy and society.
        </p>

        <p>
          Focusing monstly on our brazilian context, we talked to farmers,
          beekeepers, researchers and companies trying to get a better
          understanding of the diferent pieces that make up the agribusiness in
          Brazil: wich kinds of seeds were more used; wich species of bees are
          more impacted by pesticides; what are the economical consequences of
          bees death in Brazil; how important are these pesticides and several
          other questions. We put together a quick flowchart with the highlights
          from our integrated journey:
        </p>

        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img

            alt=""
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Therefore, we focused our efforts on building a human-centered design,
          based on feedbacks we received from our key stakeholders to repeatedly
          understand and improve our project, making sure that we could develop
          it in a safer and more responsible way. With their help, the project
          grew to the Let.it.bee. of today and will continue to grow into the
          Let.it.bee. of the future, saving bees and the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Knowing the problem</h2>

        <p>
          In order for us to come up with ideas as to how we can deal with the
          bee's disappearance problem, we had to understand
          <b>the problem and its causes.</b>
        </p>

        <div class="has-text-centered">
          <br />
          <p>
            <b
              >What causes the phenomenon? Why should people pay attention to
              this problem?</b
            >
          </p>

          <br />
        </div>
        <p>
          For that, we had to contact
          <b>scientific researchers in the area</b> to familiarize ourselves
          with what was known so far about the scenario in Brazil and other
          countries, it was the first step to understand who were our
          stakeholders and how we could get in contact. So, we reached out to
          experts in <b>bee ecotoxicology and other studies:</b>

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          In summary, we understood that the
          <b>real importance of bees for the world</b> is much more extensive
          than we originally thought, only then
          <b>grasping at the full scenario of the phenomenon.</b> The most
          important facts we learned were:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b
              >Bees have a major participation in the economy and food
              production</b
            >, by pollinating crops. Losing them would mean products with less
            quality and less quantity, harming farmers and companies in the
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Neonicotinoids have an especially aggressive effect on bees because
            <b
              >even a little bit of contaminated pollen can harm and destroy an
              entire colony.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Still, <b>they are largely used around</b> the world despite having
            been <b>highly associated with the bees' disappearance.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            We learned about some
            <b>enzymes that could possibly detoxify neonicotinoids.</b> They are
            not naturally present in bees' genomes, so there was a possibility
            of their action being very helpful for detoxification.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Through the contact with <b>A.B.E.L.H.A,</b> through Dr. Ana Lucia
          Assad, we also learned:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What kind of projects are already being done when it comes to bee
            conservation, <b>how our project could help</b> along with these
            other initiatives
          </li>
          <li>
            That
            <b
              >there haven't been any other projects like ours, and that it
              could even be commercially interesting</b
            >
            to some agribusiness companies.
          </li>
          <li>
            She also directed us to her contact in <b>Embrapa</b>, a public
            agricultural research corporation and
            <b>one of the biggest names in sustainable development</b> here in
            Brazil, and also <b>Ouro Fino</b>, Brazilian
            <b>manufacturer of crop protection products.</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This set our plan and objectives for the project:
          <b
            >to protect bees from the neonicotinoids by degrading them with an
            enzyme, with the goal to have a positive impact on the economy and
            environment.</b
          >
          The next step was to fully design it.
        </p>

        <h2>Idealizing the initial design</h2>

        <p>
          With the discoveries, we began to formulate our project and understand
          what agents could be targeted. We decided to target the neonicotinoid
          directly at its source and try and express
          <b>our desired modification on a plant</b> thus protecting the
          pollinators that would come into contact and their colony aswell.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among all types of neonicotinoids, we settled on working with
          <b>imidacloprid</b>, since it is the most used pesticide around the
          world, so our project could be more comprehensive and potentially
          apply more crops [3].
        </p>

        <p>
          By researching in literature, we found reports of many enzymes from
          the CYP P450 superfamily that were able to metabolize neonicotinoids
          and other types of pesticides, options that we could use for our
          project. Then, we contacted a
          <b>specialist in plant molecular biology</b> in our university,
          <b>Dr. Igor Cesarino</b>, who became one of our Principal
          Investigators (PIs). With his help, we were able to fully finish the
          <b>first draft of our project's design</b>:
        </p>

        <div class="has-text-centered">
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Generally expressing a metabolizing enzyme in a plant</b>, to
            make it safe for bees.
          </p>
          <br />
        </div>

        <p>
          His counseling also led us to our initial model plant, the
          <b>Arabidopsis Thaliana</b>, because it has a small size, a small life
          cycle and it is also a well-known scientific model, features that
          would be very helpful for our project's planning and development.
        </p>

        <h2>Improving the design</h2>

        <p>
          After gathering some information about bees and having the first draft
          of our project in hand, we needed to dive more into other topics about
          the actual usage of neonicotinoids on the crops. We focused on
          confirming the information we had gathered till then and particularly
          answer the questions:
        </p>

        <div class="has-text-centered">
          <br />
          <p>
            <b
              >How are they used in crops? Why are they used in the first
              place?</b
            >
          </p>
          <br />
        </div>

        <p>
          For this purpose, we scheduled meetings with two specialists: one is
          an <b>expert in agronomy and application of phytosanitaries</b> and
          the other is an
          <b
            >expert in bees from one of the most important agricultural research
            companies in Brazil.</b
          >
        </p>

        TOGGLE SERGIO E CRISTIANO

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          From this step in our Human Practices, we gathered even more material
          about the scenario and the
          <b>use of the pesticide we intend to work on</b>. The data were
          crucial for our project's design, aiding us in improving it. The most
          important information we learned were:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The most used method of application for imidacloprid is
            <b>seed treatment</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Imidacloprid is very effective as a pesticide and, because of that,
            it also makes it an <b>environmentally safer option</b> for crops.
          </li>
          <li>
            Colony Collapse Disorder is officially reported in USA and Europe,
            but not in Brazil. But here the main cause for the bees'
            disappearance is <b>acute intoxication</b>, strongly related to
            pesticide use.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Putting these facts together, we realized that
          <b>maintaining the function of imidacloprid</b> was very important,
          therefore we could not degrade it in the whole plant's body. We needed
          to focus on tissues that put bees, and other pollinators, at risk:
          <b>the pollen</b>. As Dr. Roberta Nocelli, in our first segment, had
          explained, it is not usually used by other insects, thus it was the
          perfect target for our project. We had to come up with a
          <b
            >method for our enzyme to be specifically expressed in that region,
            through the use of a locally expressed promoter with minimal off
            targets.</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Through our PI, Dr. Igor Cesarino, we came into contact with
          <b>Dr. Maria Magdalena Rossi</b>, who is also specialized in plant
          molecular biology, with a focus on tomato plants. With their guidance,
          we decided to <b>change our model plant to the Micro-Tom</b>(<i
            >Solanum lycopersicum</i
          >), aiming for the best possible result for our project, for a long
          range of reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><i>A. thaliana</i> does not have an optimal growth</b> in our
            university (as opposed to Micro-Tom). It could endanger the small
            time we had for it to grow enough for experiments, as well as it
            could possibly not have enough material for us to collect, since we
            would need to test pollen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><i>A. thaliana</i> is not a crop</b>, it does not have a
            commercial interest as much as it has a huge importance for
            research.
          </li>
          <li>
            They share <b>important features for model plants</b>: short life
            cycle, small size, high density, easy to grow and transform.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          So we settled on a final decision of using the Micro-Tom as our
          chassis, also locking our promoter decision based on its genome. That
          was essential for the completion of our circuit's design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another important thing about the meetings is that they brought up a
          very important question for our future implementation, which is the
          spray application of imidacloprid that could perhaps affect bees that
          come in contact with contaminated pollen surfaces. The misuse of
          pesticides seems to be a huge problem, considering that protocols are
          not always being applied, which could prevent deaths caused by
          possible spray applications. Although that can be of worry, the main
          method for the substance is still seed treatment, guaranteeing the
          imidacloprid in pollen to be metabolized [4]. Thus, it is possible for
          it to be absorbed into the plant's system when not lost through
          environmental factors like wind and sunlight. Either way, it is
          possible to improve Let.it.bee. in the future, with new mechanisms.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can summarize the important results as being the final design of
          our project:
          <b
            >a circuit with a pollen-specific promoter, a CYP P450 enzyme (with
            a system for optimized reporter gene expression), to be expressed as
            a test in Micro-Tom.</b
          >
        </p>
        <h2>Modeling</h2>

        <p>
          With the pandemic restrictions, we
          <b>did not have access to our labs</b> for at least three-quarters of
          the project, so the dry lab work in mathematical modeling and
          simulations gained special importance for us to have some insight into
          our project's operation. One of the simulations is a
          <b>beehive, bees and plants simulation,</b> a macromolecular view on
          our project aiming to <b>understand and predict its efficiency</b> in
          protecting bees populations.
        </p>

        <p>
          For our simulation to be as faithful to reality as possible, we still
          needed much more knowledge in how bees behave in the real world and
          how the details of our project can affect them. So our basic questions
          to answer were:
        </p>

        <div class="has-text-centered">
          <br />
          <p>
            <b
              >How bees behave? What bees should we use? How are they
              contaminated and what effects should be considered?</b
            >
          </p>
          <br />
        </div>

        <p>
          We reached out the researcher <b>Astrid de Matos Peixoto Kleinert</b>,
          an ecologist with an emphasis in Behavioral Ecology and Ecology of
          Communities, to talk about how behavior varies along different
          species, what variables should be taken into account in the modelling:
        </p>

        DROPDOWN ASTRID FOTO

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          Our meeting helped us realize the route our beehive, bees and plants
          simulation should go. With it we learned that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The most
            <b
              >adequate model for our plant, the Micro-Tom, is the
              <i>Bombus sp.</i></b
            >
            bee since is one of the main pollinators of tomato plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            There can be <b>different types of contaminations</b>, since there
            are <b>different methods of colleting pollen</b> (vibrating,
            touching, biting) and also different types of flowers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because of that,
            <b>contamination can be by contact or ingestion:</b> the pollen
            sticks to the forager bees, so when they come back to the hive, it
            also contaminates the others;
          </li>
          <li>
            For our ecological modeling,
            <b>we must consider the different paterns of bees</b>, gathering
            data about pheromones and internal recruitment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In short, Dr. Astrid Kleinert gave us a lot of insight into the
          variables and conditions needed to be considered into our simulation
          and the overall result was our model of how <i>Bombus sp</i> in a crop
          treated with imidacloprid is affected by Let.it.bee. plants.
        </p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>

        <p>
          The regulation for genetically modified organisms can be a bit tricky
          and safety is a very necessary discussion for the development and
          possible implementation of Let.it.bee.. Luckily for us, we found
          <b>The Cornell Alliance for Science</b>, an organization from Cornell
          University that seeks to promote access to scientific innovation as a
          means of enhancing food security, improving environmental
          sustainability, and raising the quality of life globally.

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          The conversation was very important for us to settle our next steps
          and guarantee the safety aspect of Let.it.bee. The main points were:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            There are still many
            <b>negative stereotypes surrounding synthetic technology</b>,
            especially when it comes to food. However, this scenario is
            changing, little by little, and we hope that our project's
            engagement, human practices and divulgation can help that, by
            showing that GMO can be used for multiple good causes.
          </li>
          <li>
            We needed the opinions of <b>end users and companies</b> for a more
            complete feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            We needed to
            <b>deeply research Brazil's regulation on GMO approval</b>, so
            Let.it.bee. can be safely commercialized in the future as well as
            safely developed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Following that conclusion, we invested in the
          <b>scientific divulgation</b> of our project, by taking information
          related to our project and GMO history and processes involved in their
          approval or making. The public education and engagement initiatives
          also tried to bring more information about synbio to the public.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, we went after the
          <b>Brazilian regulation over GMO and patents</b>, searching the main
          organizations related to it, such as CTNbio (the institute responsible
          for GMO biosafety and policies) and MAPA, our Ministry of Agriculture,
          Livestock and Supply, responsible for guidance in approval of new
          cultivars. From them, we managed to develop our project as safely as
          possible along with the guidelines and also learned about what tests
          and procedures our plant would have to go through in the future,
          proving its function, safety and stability.
        </p>

        <h2>After iGEM</h2>
        <h3>Faculty Meeting</h3>

        <p>
          We wanted to create an event that could gather many
          <b
            >members from the faculty of several universities specialized in
            various parts of our project</b
          >: from bee behavior and ecotoxicology to molecular biology, synthetic
          biology, mathematical modeling, chemical substances, plant physiology,
          among other topics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The objective was to show them our projects and
          <b
            >gather feedback from multiple areas** to improve them, as well as
            introduce them to our team.</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a <b>two-part webinar,</b> between which the professors were
          divided into according to their specialization (but they could see as
          many events as they wished):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            One focusing on the <b>bees' disappearance situation</b> (what are
            the agents, what is happening to them, what do we want to change)
            and the <b>molecular/synthetic biology</b> aspects, such as our
            circuit, the experiments we planned to do and our chosen chassis.
          </li>
          <li>
            And the other focusing on the
            <b><i>in silico</i>and mathematical modeling</b> section of our
            project, what were the modeling projects, what questions were we
            trying to answer and how.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It was <b>totally online</b>, organized through a platform for online
          events called Doity and was streamed via guest emails and our YouTube
          channel. That also allowed us to reach a bigger public than first
          intended, as it was open for YouTube users.

          />
        </figure>

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          It was a very welcoming and warming event that generated multiple
          questions and insightful feedback, helping us understand what were the
          <b>major points of doubt about our project</b> and that would need
          more justification or improvement after the competition. Some of them
          were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How are we working on our mathematical modeling?</li>
          <li>Why did we choose to genetically modify a plant and not bees?</li>
          <li>Why did we choose to work with the Micro-Tom?</li>
          <li>
            Which species of bees would we be using as a model for the study?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, our Faculty Meeting was a success! We collected many views
          and comments about our development, also promoting our team. It led to
          <b>new connections</b> and more knowledge to integrate in the
          <b>future of our project and improve our presentation</b> focusing on
          key questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We should look into how our project would affect the life of overall
          bees and pollinators considering the different types of behaviour and
          especially the different methods of collecting pollen.
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation: Farmers and beekeepers</h3>

        <p>
          An essential part of implementation is to understand the end-users
          benefits and interests. Some of the stakeholders we considered were
          <b>farmers</b>, that could apply Let.it.bee. in their crops, and
          <b>beekeepers</b>, whose bees can suffer from the disappearance
          phenomenon caused by pesticides.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pandemic was a big obstacle to our communication with them. In the
          initial part of our project, we planned to eventually establish a
          conversation in person, when the pandemic was in a better situation,
          as it was being very hard to reach them through on-line methods. But
          <b>the situation never got better enough, unfortunately.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          We resorted to trying to communicate through <b>Facebook groups</b>,
          where we found communities of farmers and beekeepers communicating in
          posts. We wrote a post quickly and simply explaining our projects and
          objectives, as well as the contextualization of our project, so it
          could be divulgated in those groups with permission and gather
          feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          We focused on: the <b>importance of bees to agriculture</b>, the
          <b>misuse of pesticides</b>, the general
          <b>description of our project</b> and questions about
          <b>possible interests in the initiative.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          Although even in this situation the communication was hard, as it
          depended on the groups' divulgation of our post, we managed to gather
          a few interesting pieces of data that point to the fact that there is
          still a lot of
          <b
            >misinformation about bees' importance and the correct use of
            pesticides.</b
          >
          Many did not fully know about their relation to agriculture or the
          relation of pesticides to the bees' disappearance and were very
          concerned about the phenomenon.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the future, with the improvement of the pandemic condition in our
          country, it would be very crucial to try to meet with them to gather
          more feedback, as well as develop an
          <b
            >educational material explaining the problematic scenario, the
            correct use of pesticides and the benefits of bees' pollination</b
          >, which could help convince people to adhere to changes.
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation: companies</h3>

        <p>
          After meeting with many specialists and other stakeholders we
          collected a lot of feedbacks that both supported our project our
          helped us find ways to improve it. We started to structure a few
          possible paths for the after iGEM (take a look at our Entrepreneurship
          page if you wish to see more about that).
        </p>

        <p>
          To get the clearest picture possible of how our technology could be
          received in the Brazilian market, we talked directly with companies
          that are involved in the agriculture and technology area. They were
          <b>Ouro Fino</b> <b>Agrosciência</b> and <b>Embrapa:</b>
        </p>

        DROPDOWN OURO FINA EMBRAPA

        <h3>What was the result?</h3>

        <p>
          With both the companies, we hope to have encompassed the opinions of
          possible stakeholders, as companies involved with pesticides and
          technologies in agriculture are the aim of our project's possible
          implementation in the real world, as the interest at having more
          productivity and a bee-friendly crop is possible. We also gathered the
          main questions about the future of our project. So, we learned that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There could be <b>real commercial interest in our project.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            We try to expand the Let.It.Bee. technology to
            <b>other plants and other pesticides.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Partnering with a well-established company could be a good idea to
            <b>fully develop our project with more structure.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Registering/patenting the technology</b> could be very important.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Together with farmers and beekeepers, they seemed very open to
          conversation, interested in our project, and also had a lot of
          questions, so there could be a real demand for our technology if we
          were to launch on a large scale. The project's objective seemed to be
          in resonance They offered great feedback as to the points that could
          be improved or thought about for the future,
          <b>influencing our after iGEM experiments</b> and planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a long way to get Let.It.Bee. here and we couldn't have done
          this without all the specialists, organizations, companies and farm
          workers who were a part of our Integrated Human Practices.
