        <h2>Biosafety</h2>
        <p>
          For the discussion of Biosafety, its definition is necessary, with
          this it is defined that:

              health."

        <p>
          From this definition, it is understood that for the handling of
          harmful organisms, reagents and compounds, there is a need to follow
          current Biosafety guidelines so that no damage occurs to the
          environment or to those handling potential risk agents. Here we will
          discuss safety around our
          <b>
            plant development
          </b>
          and some ethical concerns regarding the
          <b>
            development of GMOs
          </b>
          and their uses.
        </p>

        <h3>Experimental design</h3>
        <p>
          To guarantee safety, we use
          <b>
            non-pathogenic vectors
          </b>
          to carry out the experiments. We inserted our genetic construct into
          the
          <b>
            Micro-Tom
          </b>
          plant (Solanum Lycopersicum), our chassis. The Micro-Tom is considered
          safe and versatile for our proof of concept, along with other
          multicellular organisms, it does not have a risk group. The biggest
          risk in our case is the production of a GMO that, if not properly
          guaranteed, could
          <i>
            propagate the new genetic modification
          </i>
          among other plants, as the modification is specific to pollen, a
          reproductive tissue. This would cause legal problems and disruption to
          biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the safety assessment of our project, our team contacted
          some
          <b>
            experts in GMO crops
          </b>
          from the best universities in our country, experts from the
          <b>
            Cornell Alliance for Science
          </b>
          and also from
          <b>
            EMBRAPA,
          </b>
          the state company responsible for agricultural innovation in our
          country. These experts guided us through the complex set of
          <b>
            biosafety laws that regulate GMO plants in Brazil,
          </b>
          while suggesting modifications and procedures that helped us manage
          the risks involved in applying our project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The regulation for GMO use in Brazil keeps the project safe, the plant
          <b>
            was not handled outside of controlled and certificated spaces,
          </b>
          as well as it will not be released unless proved to be safe under the
          law.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Types of organisms used in our project and their potential risks
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>
              Escherichia coli K-12 derivatives
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              Agrobacterium tumefaciens
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              Solanum lycopersicum
            </i>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the development of our project, we thought about which organisms
          would be involved and which risks they could represent for us and for
          the environment while they were being manipulated. With that, we came
          to the conclusion that we would use the Micro-Tom
          <i>
            (Solanum lycopersicum)
          </i>
          as chassis. One of the risks involved in using this plant as a chassis
          is the occurrence of
          <b>
            cross-pollination
          </b>
          with wild plants if it escaped the laboratory. Another organism we use
          as a test vector and genetic construct is
          <i>
            Escherichia coli,
          </i>
          a known pathogen that causes diarrhea in humans but is easily
          treatable with antibiotics. No exotic selection marker was used to
          keep it sensitive to first-line antibiotics of treatment. However, the
          <i>
            E. coli K-12
          </i>
          strain and its derivatives are known as "lab strains" in the human
          digestive system and
          <b>
            do not produce toxins.
          </b>
          Therefore, it does not cause disease in healthy adult humans. As for
          foreign DNA, eukaryotic
          <b>
            proteins fail to retain their function
          </b>
          when expressed in bacterial structures, so we expect this to pose very
          little risk. Finally, we use
          <i>
            Agrobacterium tumefaciens
          </i>
          which can cause opportunistic infections in humans and mutations in
          plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to make it clear that in this project
          <b>
            we do not use bees
          </b>
          as an experimentation model for measuring the interaction with the
          plant in question. Instead, we use
          <b>
            mathematical modeling
          </b>
          strategies to predict the bee's interactions with an unmodified plant
          and mortality rates due to the use of pesticides such as Imidacloprid.
        </p>

        <h3>Laboratory safety</h3>
        <p>
          During our experiments, we had access to different types of
          laboratories within the University of São Paulo. One is a specialized
          <b>
            level 1 laboratory for experiments involving genetically modified
            plants,
          </b>
          where we could also carry out our molecular experiments. We also had
          access to a
          <b>
            level 2 laboratory for possible enzyme assay experiments as well as
            chemical material manipulation.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          All laboratories were controlled environments, following all correct
          <b>
            protocols for waste management, ventilation and access and signage.
          </b>
          We made sure to send people with biosafety certificates and laboratory
          training to carry out the experiments, always maintaining the correct
          use of Personal Protective Equipment
          <b>
            (PPE),
          </b>
          as well as following all the correct
          <b>
            pandemic protection guidelines
          </b>
          (use of masks and distancing ). In addition, all laboratories have
          technical professionals responsible for the environment who assisted
          in the procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main areas used in the laboratory were: bench, greenhouse and
          chemical hood. All were used carefully, with the correct use of PPE
          and monitoring by technicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          We researched and set up protocols for the experiments that would need
          to be carried out, namely: plant pollen extraction, GUS assay, PCR,
          rt-PCR. We followed the protocols, also considering all biosafety
          issues and looking for the most adequate laboratory and team to
          perform them.
        </p>

        <!--- Biosecurity --->
        <h2>Biosecurity</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike biosafety, which aims to control risks that can compromise
          human, animal and environmental health, biosecurity includes
          <b>
            institutional safety measures
          </b>
          to prevent the misuse or intentional release of risk agents (CARDOSO,
          2008).
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking this into account, it is very important that aspects related to
          research in the area of GMOs are considered so that the intentional
          release of GMOs in nature is avoided without prior research and
          delimitation of area and use.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>
          In sciences, whether human, exact or biological, in addition to
          biosafety, the
          <b>
            ethical aspect
          </b>
          of the projects being planned and carried out must always be
          considered.
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="CARDOSO, Telma Abdalla de Oliveira">
          <p>
            <cite>
              "It is a characteristic trait of human beings to ask Nature
              questions – it can be said that this behavior is what
              differentiates them from other animals. Thus, the human being, at
              the same time as having the behavior of a “philosopher” (asking
              questions), also has of “researcher” (searches for answers). It is
              the inevitable destiny of human beings, therefore, to be an
              “eternal researcher”; it is their destiny to seek new knowledge.
              In this search, the human being had to become aware of the other
              and the world and, as a result, he had to reflect on the issue of
              “human values”. And so, besides worrying about “philosophy” and
              “research”, he had to deal also with ethics.” [3]
            </cite>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Considering this aspect, throughout the project, we respect the
          guidelines of the research ethics committee. The project
          <b>
            did not require the use of animals or invertebrates.
          </b>
          Even so, we follow all
          <b>
            Brazilian regulations
          </b>
          in terms of working with Genetically Modified Organisms and working
          with plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the
          <b>
            Human Practices
          </b>
          area, we were careful to always explain everything we would do, to ask
          permission for questionnaires and interviews, and to request
          authorization from the person in case these were disclosed. We have
          always kept everything that was not authorized or owned
          confidentially.
        </p>

        <h3>COVID-19</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the situation of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-9 virus,
          the team focused more on the
          <b>
            modeling part and
            <em>
              in silico
            </em>
            experiments.
          </b>
          All experiments carried out in person, involving plants and the wet
          lab, were performed by totally vaccinated people, maintaining a
          restriction on the number of people per laboratory, use of masks and a
          distance of 1 meter per person.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other projects that would occasionally need a face-to-face meeting
          also followed all the regulations established by the health agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that,
          <b>
            everything was done remotely during the two-year duration of the
            project.
          </b>
