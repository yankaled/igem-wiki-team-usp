        <h2>THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC</h2>

        <p>
          The Covid-19 pandemic hit Brasil harshly throughout the past two
          years. Mismanagement of the country's public health services lead to a
          prolonged lockdown in our university, hindering access to the
          laboratories where we were to perform most of our wet-lab experiments.
          Therefore, most assays were performed in the final months of iGEM,
          when labs finally reopened. Despite the rush, we were able to obtain
          promising results regarding the integration and expression of
          Let.it.bee on our transgenic plants.
        </p>

        <h3>Transformation of plants</h3>

        ESQUEMA

        <p>
          The Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation with our designed plasmid
          for LAT52-CYP6G1-GUS was carried with success on for positive
          transformant resistents a kanamycin medium (Figure1).
        </p>

        figura1

        <p>
          The transformed plants have grown sufficiently well and taken roughly
          one month to develop their reproductive system, necessary for pollen
          production. We observe that the T0 transformants grow slower than
          other control plants and have lower pollen production.
        </p>

        <h3>Plants samples</h3>

        <p>
          Plants with 7 cm length were moved at the greenhouse, localized in
          Departamento de Botânica - IB - USP (23°33'59.7"S 46°43'49.9"W) at the
          beginning of 2021 August (Figure 3). The greenhouse was acclimatized
          for natural daylight with a controlled temperature of 30°C.

        <h3>Identification of positive transformants</h3>

        esquema microtom leaf

        <p>
          We screened 12 random lines of transformant plants by PCR. After the
          validation of the quality of DNA extraction of the adapted methodology
          [1], as the first PCR result, we have found 3 transformants positives
          to LAT52-CYP6G1-GUS cassette, T2, T22 and T25 (Figure 2).
        </p>

        figura 2, gel

        <p>
          The results indicate a successful integration of our cassette in the
          plant, but with lower quantity with respect to all transformants, 25%
          (3/12). It is can be explained by the random insertion after
          transfection by agrobacterium. Due to the time it took for pollen
          production, we could only used the pollen from the T2 transformant to
          quantify the CYP6G1 transcript and GUS transcript. We used as control
          the leaves for compare regulation expression by LAT52 promoter.
        </p>
        <h3>qRT-PCR</h3>

        <p>
          Genic expression at transcript level was assessed for two target
          genes, CYP6G1 and GUS, and "Expressed", a reference gene for tomato.
          RT-qPCR assays were successfully carried out and primers efficiencies
          were determined: 96.4% (r²=0.982) for CYP2, 95.8% (r²=0.979) for GUS,
          and 107.6% (r²=0.994) for "Expressed". Significative expression at
          transcript level for CYP2 (median Ct value of 21.4) and GUS (median Ct
          value of 20.5) genes were detected only for pollen of transgenic
          plants (median Ct values were above 31.9 for both genes in cDNA
          samples from pollen and leaves of control plants and from leaves of
          transgenic plants, as well as undetermined for both genes in negative
          control). These findings confirm the specific expression of CYP6G1 and
          GUS genes, at least at the transcriptional level, in the pollen of
          transgenic tomato plants and its functionality to produce in vivo
          transcripts (Table 1).
        </p>

        <p>
          The Ct represents the minimum threshold that the fluorescence must be
          detectable for indicating some amplification, without being as noises
          of the machine detector. Pollen, leaf controls and Leaf T2 showed
          great or indeterminate values of Ct, which indicate the absence of
          transcripts in these tissues. The proximity of Ct between GUS and CYP2
          is a plausible value since they are products of the same transcript,
          regulated by promoter LAT52. The presence of a faint signal in the
          negative control for pollen and in the leaves indicate either possible
          contamination or the formation of dimers from the primers.
        </p>

        <h3>Biochemichemical Experiments - GUS</h3>

        <p>
          Let.it.bee has the reporter gene β-glucuronidase (GUS) which is
          translated of the same trascript of CYP6G1. Therefore, the activity of
          one of the two enzymes, if detected, would show strong evidence of the
          expression of the whole construct. GUS activity is fairly easy to
          detect as it metabolizes 5-Bromo-4-Chloro-3-Indolyl β-D-Glucuronide
          (X-Gluc) into other c indigo blue. Nonetheless, it also allows
          histochemical colouring in pluricellular organisms, serving also as a
          tissue specificity indicator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Positive results were obtained for 2 and 22, transformants that we
          alredy knew were positive for our circuit. The negative (-C) and
          positive (+C) controls rendered correct results, validating the
          experiment.
        </p>

        FIGURE 3

        <p>
          Micro-tom 2 and 22 were confirmed to presence of GUS activiy. As we
          could not get pollen from plant 2 Genomic PCR confirmed the presence
          of the construct in both lineages. Even though it was not possible to
          extract fresh pollen from plant number 2, pollen grains attached to
          its ovarium walls were stained during the flower staining experiment.
          Nevertheless, Let.it.bee's expression was later confirmed in plant
          number 2 through RT-qPCR.
        </p>

        <p>
          One might notice that the amount of stained pollen cells is fairly
          small. Additionally, the intensity of the blue hue also varies between
          grains. However odd this may look, those were expected results. The
          reason for that is that all experiments were carried out with T0
          plants (generation number 0 of the transgenic lineages). It is known
          that agrobacterium mediated transformation happens randomly [20-21]
          and not all cells are transformed equally. Therefore, the plant
          presents a chimeric genotype in which the expression of the Let.it.bee
          construct is expected to vary among different cells and be absent in
          the majority of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The flower tissue staining procedure failed as the positive control
          used for it did not stain. A possible reason for that is the lack of a
          vacuum pump to push x-gluc into the cells. Therefore, it wasn't
          possible to determine whether the LAT52 promoter was leaking to
          adjacent tissues. Nevertheless, that assumption was previously
          confirmed in the literature and later through RT-qPCR of leaf tissue.
