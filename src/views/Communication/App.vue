        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our team has always been very excited to work with public engagement
          and education. This excitement was so big that we ended up developing
          a lot of different projects.
        </p>

        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img
            src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/8/85/T--USP-Brazil--IGEM-USP-Education-%26-Comunication-planner.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Back in 2020, most of our team members had never taken part in iGEM,
          so we started by
          <b>looking into what other successful teams had done</b>, reaching out
          to understand what public engagement and education really meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we had virtual boot camps and brainstorming sessions during our
          weekly meetings to gather ideas on how to engage and educate the
          public despite the restrictions demanded by the Covid-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing on our Social Media seemed like a great path for a first
          initiative. During the pandemic, the problem with misinformation
          escalated:
        </p>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img
            src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/4/40/T--USP-Brazil--IGEM-USP--Education-%26-Comunication-FAKE-NEWS.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          In the urge of alleviating this scenario, we created the
          <b>#HeroisNaCiencia (#HeroesInScience)</b>, sharing stories and
          experiences from the researchers studying Sars-Cov-2 and how they were
          affected by everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, we also wanted to be more involved with educational projects.
          In Brazil, synthetic biology is one of the least known areas among the
          different sciences. Even in the academy, there are few synbio projects
          and studies. Because of that, we wanted to encourage it by spreading
          the word among kids and teenagers.
        </p>
        <p>
          High Schoolers are the future of our universities and the Academy.
          Having this in mind and moved by the inspiration of our own
          experiences with academic olympiads, we decided to reach out to these
          students in an innovative way. After hours of discussion and
          brainstorming sections, we agreed to use investigative teaching as the
          flagship of our project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after, we reached out to other olympiad founders and
          pedagogues to learn more about investigative teaching. Then, we formed
          a partnership with Fractal and the Vertere Institute to launch it
          nationwide culminating at the beginning of the first
          <b
            >Brazilian Synthetic Biology Olympiad. Also, we had to take other
            factors into account. Public and private schools children in Brazil
            have different scientific backgrounds. Having this in mind, we
            decided to face the problem in two different ways. Firstly and
            concerning the olympiad, we decided to create two different
            categories for these students. The second solution, though, was the
            inspiration for our new project the Scientific Camp in which we
            would</b
          >
          build workshops that could further the students' knowledge and
          encourage their scientific curiosity in order to lessen the knowledge
          gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          We partnered with other student entities from our university and asked
          for guidance from renowned professors to build the project. Besides,
          we worked with two educational institutions this year, the NGO
          Alavanca do Brasil and the elementary school Samuel Klabin. Besides
          these projects, we also participated in a few interviews and round
          tables to <b>spread the word</b> and further the discussion of
          synthetic biology with the public. <span id="Heroes"></span>
        </p>
        <!-- Cada um desses é um dropdown-->
        <h2>Herois Na Ciencia (Heroes in Science)</h2>
        <p>
          For our presence on digital platforms, we use the following social
          media: <b>Linkedin, Instagram, Facebook and Youtube</b>. On Linkedin,
          in addition to information about the project, we announce our
          participations in newspaper articles, interviews, meetings held with
          teams from all over the world (Canada, South Korea, Mexico, etc.) and
          several other events that we participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Instagram was initially used to share our daily life and sporadic
          reports about our project. The experiments carried out in the
          laboratories were posted, as well as bits from the members' daily iGEM
          routine. Eventually the account was restructured, shifting the focus
          to creating content about the team, the Let.it.Bee. project, the iGEM
          competition and science outreach in general. We also relaunched our
          Youtube chanel as a platform for livestreams, such as those we made in
          partnership with P&G, and animations produced by the members.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020 we created the <b>visual identity</b> with our own color
          palette, templates to standardize posts and defined an official logo
          for the Let.it.Bee project. With the creation of new content, we
          started to get more attention and the number of followers started to
          rise. In 2021, with the new members joining the team, numerous ideas
          emerged and that increased demands for our media work. To organize the
          workflow, our media squad delimited
          <b>five stages of production, namely:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Brainstorming of ideas, researching and reading about the content;
          </li>
          <li>Compiling the content and writing the captions for the post;</li>
          <li>Designing the post acording to the project's visual identity;</li>
          <li>
            Reviewing the content and translating the captions into English;
          </li>
          <li>
            Posting the material and dissemination on other team networks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to this organization and constancy of publications,
          another factor that contributed to our growth on the internet were the
          topics from the posts. We covered various
          <b>subjects related to science</b>, linking them to our project and at
          the same with a fun, didactic and visual aproach. One of our posts
          with the highest engagement rate was about how bees communicated by
          dancing to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investment in social media also gave us
          <b>greater visibility with other teams</b>, we started to receive a
          lot of messages and the number of proposals for collaborations through
          Instagram increased significantly. Currently, our online presence is
          three times greater when compared to 2020, however, the work carried
          out in 2020 year was crucial for the progress of Let.it.bee., and it
          was through social media that our first public education project
          emerged, the #HeroisNaCiência.

        </figure>

        <p>
          The <b>#HeroisNaCiencia</b> was an campaign launched through social
          media by the team USP BR. This initiative consisted in inviting
          brazilian (and some international) researchers to share, trough short
          clips,
          <b
            >how their research work were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
            the actions they put forward to help combat the virus</b
          >. The project also tries to highlight the impacts of the pandemic on
          the day-to-day life of these researchers, humanizing science and
          bringing them closer to society.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all started when members of the group, sympathizing with the
          front-line professionals on the struggle against the coronavirus and
          noting the <b>widespread desinformation</b> across the country,
          decided to contribute. With a team composed by 26 students across many
          institutes (Biology (IB), biomedical sciences (ICB), pharmaceutical
          sciences (FCF), mathematics (IME) and Comunicantions and arts (ECA))
          it was possible to contact the researchers, gather reliable
          information and present them in a simpler way to society. Thus the
          #HeroisNaCiencia became <b>one of our first projects.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the projects published, there are:
          <b>studies on the structures of SARS-CoV-2</b>, studies on the
          <b>pathophysiology of Covid-19</b>, the
          <b>genetic sequencing of patients affected by this disease</b>, the
          creation of <b>biobanks</b>, development of
          <b>study models with pulmonary cells</b>, studies of multiple
          <b>treatment methods</b>, production of <b>face-shields</b>,
          <b>vaccine development</b>, development and improvement of
          <b>diagnostic methods</b>, and actions on
          <b>applying diagnostic</b> on the frontline.

          In partnership with the group
          <b><i>Bioscientista Mirim</i> ( "Little Bioscientist")</b>, from the
          Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo
          (ICB-USP),
          <b
            >we won the Public Notice <i>Aprender na Comunidade</i> (“Learning
            in the Community'')</b
          >, focused on social and educational actions connecting the scientific
          community with the society, in order to complement the student's
          professional skills. Looking for a project that could both:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Help prepare elementary students to take part in the Brazilian
            Synthetic Biology Olympiad (our other Public Education project) in
            the future;
          </li>
          <li>
            Share our work and knowledge with sectors of society more distant
            from academia.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Scientific Camp's mission</h3>
        <p>
          To expand students' scientific wonder and knowledge through logical
          activities in public schools of the state of São Paulo, using
          children's daily lives as a basis for interactive and fun activities
          going beyond expository classes in a conventional classroom; to awaken
          their interest in science, bringing children closer to the scientific
          work in a pleasurable and stimulating way; and to help the development
          of scientific skills, such as taking a critical look at the world,
          discussing and creating hypothesis to solve problems, in addition to
          encouraging teamwork, with monitors and with colleagues.
        </p>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">

            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <h4>How?</h4>
        <p>
          We were inspired by a method called <i><b>gamification</b></i
          >, which consists of
          <b>using game mechanics to improve children's learning</b>. It is
          widely used nowadays, mainly for educational purposes. As more and
          more games are part of the daily lives of young people, this strategy
          establishes the learning process in an interactive way. Then, we
          studied through books and internet media about this methodology of
          teaching. However, we were not fulfilled by reading only, making us
          put this knowledge into practice in our scientific camp.
        </p>
        <h4>Learning through interviews</h4>
        <p>
          Thus, we spoke with <b>professionals</b> who study the application of
          games in education, with the biologist <b>Rafael de Lima</b>, who
          teaches about sharks using games as an educational tool, and the
          psychologist <b>Fábio Medeiros</b>, master and doctoral student in
          Communication and Education we learn about how to make activities more
          engaging with characters and challenges thinking about the difficulty
          to solve and know-how abilities are needed to reach goals in every
          type of activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          After talking to them we decided to apply the strategy of the
          so-called <b>“role-play games”</b>, or RPGs, in which players take on
          the characters' roles and participate in a narrative while building it
          as a group. From their feedback, we realized this would be a great way
          for the students to engage with the material and help them develop
          group work, critical thinking and communication through an interactive
          unpublished story.
        </p>
        <h3>Planning the event</h3>
        <p>
          Thinking about pedagogy, we needed to develop strategic thinking about
          the application. For that, we spoke with a specialist in non-formal
          education, the biologist professor <b>Alessandra Bezerra</b>>. She had
          been working with kids in
          <b>São Remo community through NGO Alavanca</b>, thereby she helped us
          with ideas about
          <b>how to reach the community interest by the project</b>, with that
          help we could do reinforcement for kids from elementary school in São
          Remo community and learn about how to reach kids using what they learn
          from school and in their daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          After these conversations, we planned what we could do with what we
          had. Then we realized that we didn't have a good background in
          education methods since just a few people in our team were in a
          teaching course. So,
          <b>we made a partnership with <i>Little Bioscientist</i></b
          >, a project active since 2017 that deals with schools in several
          communities as São Remo. They have made diverse activities to middle
          schoolers about biomedical themes like bacteria and protozoa, It had
          been applied by their own teachers by a capacitation course arranged
          by the group or as a workshop with <i><b>Little Bioscientist</b></i
          >. They helped us connect subjects with each other, prioritize and
          make a purpose for every activity that would be applied in
          <i>Scientific Camp</i>. Besides, they guided us into planning
          activities in a simpler way, which would be
          <b>easy for kids to understand</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Pedagogical thinking and reinforcement</h3>
        <p>
          We also did a
          <b

          It was an incredible opportunity to bring the iGEM USP Synthetic
          Biology Team closer to the local community. Also, we all learned
          important lessons during our time working in this project, especially
          how to deal with children, how important playful games were and how to
          engage the public.

          Both <b>teachers and children gave positive feedback</b> to us. About
          the teachers, they stated that it was the children's first contact
          with science, as some had not had many science classes in schools yet,
          and they also emphasized the importance of active methodology in
          teaching and the importance of games in learning. As for the children,
          they have fun with the games and they made them learn interesting
          experiments, with cases of children who even repeated the experiments
          at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Counting mistakes and successes, it was a great experience for
          everyone and
          <b
            >brought knowledge and entertainment for both the children and the
            monitors</b
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Planning activities</h3>
        <p>
          To increase the repertoire of activities, we started partnering with
          university extensions and education groups at USP:
        </p>

        <h4><i>Estação Biologia</i> ("Biology Station")</h4>
        <p>
          A non-formal teaching space at the Biosciences Institute (IB-USP) that
          has several recreational activities on biology and natural sciences;
        </p>
        <h4><i>Química em Ação</i>("Chemistry in action")</h4>
        <p>
          A group from the Institute of Chemistry (IQ-USP), with activities
          involving impressive and funny chemical experiments for children;
        </p>
        <h4><i>Show da Física</i> ("Physics Show")</h4>
        <p>
          A group of educational activities from the Institute of Physics
          (IF-USP), which collaborated with an activity about optics and
          concepts of microscopy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, we created unprecedented activities aimed at furthering some
          of the scientific concepts the kids were already familiar with and
          learning new content, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Synthetic Biology;</li>
          <li>Genetics;</li>
          <li>Environmental conservation and ecology;</li>
          <li>Solubility and saturation of solutions;</li>
          <li>Cytology;</li>
          <li>Optics;</li>
          <li>Optics;</li>
          <li>Scientific method.</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img
            src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/0/07/T--USP-Brazil--IGEM-USP--Education-%26-Comunication-Activities.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Thinking about the application to achieve the greatest number of kids,
          we chose to use the internet as the main resource. For that reason,
          our activities were designed to be <b>short</b>, <b>interactive</b>,
          <b>fun</b> and <b>interesting</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Realization of the event</h3>
        <p>
          Our target audience was mainly
          <b
            >secondary school students, between 11 and 15 years old, from public
            schools</b
          >. We formed a partnership with Samuel Klabin school, a school in Vila
          Dalva that is attended by students from various communities in the
          region near the University of São Paulo, and a fantastic story was
          developed: our heroes (the children), through the resolution of
          challenges, scientific activities and workshops, were able, little by
          little, to discover a magical adventure relating science to everyday
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <b>Whatsapp and Google Meets</b> as platforms, we carried out 6
          days of activities, spread over 2 weeks, between the 6th of August and
          the 13th of September 2021. The interaction with students was almost
          entirely virtual, with the exception of two in-person visits on the
          first and last day, <b>respecting all sanitary limits</b> required
          during the pandemic.
        </p>
        <h3>The story</h3>
        <p>
          The creation of an <b>original story</b> was a completely new process
          for us. The objective was to create a narrative that followed the main
          interests of the children, had missions that would be applied as
          scientific activities, and that would represent the region and the
          daily lives of the students. Therefore, we created ways to find out
          the types of media and content that children most consumed. Just as we
          were thinking, we realized that most of the schools and regions where
          the students lived, had graffiti on the walls, which inspired us to
          create stories based on the graffiti present on the walls of the
          target school.
        </p>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img

            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          From that, we had several brainstorming sessions to build the
          structure, characters, and form of application of the activities.
          After writing the script, we divided the team to build an audiovisual
          material that would facilitate the monitoring of all students. In
          order to be more engaging and fun for the narrative, the characters
          were made with scenarios, images, and dubbing effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to thank everyone who helped in this process. In
          specific our collaborators who we got to know during the scientific
          camp program:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Tânia Alves da Costa</b>, storyteller who performed the dubbing
            of the narration;
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Flavia Maria Fusaro dos Santos Perazzolo</b>, music and artist
            who performed the dubbing of one of the characters;
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Marluza Stauffer Sperber Lopes de Carvalho</b>, a storyteller who
            performed the dubbing of two of the characters.
          </li>

        <p>Here's the synopsis description:</p>
        <p>
          "Once, there was a village with magical beasts. They lived in peace
          with the people until war raged on. The leader of the creatures, a
          great dragon, betrayed all, killed the village chief and tried to
          gather all the magical power of the region. However, a brave warrior
          stopped her with his legendary spear. Right before the warrior could
          strike the final blow, the dragon's magic trapped him in stone, along
          with all the animals that aided in the fight against the forces of
          evil... This legend took place decades ago, and it is said that you
          can still sense the power of those beasts nowadays. Our story starts
          with the young heroes of Vila Dalva, as one day they are chased by
          mysterious beings of shadows and helped by a strange voice. Follow
          them in this adventure, where they learn that this old story has much
          more to it than is told."

          During the preparation of the Scientific Camp,
          <b>Weekly meetings</b> with each of the teaching extensions happened,
          which allowed us to create and reform around <b>8 activities</b>,
          applied during the 6 days of the Scientific Camp Event.
        </p>

        <h4>Microbe Drop</h4>
        <p>
          The <i>Microbe Drop</i> is an experiment where a laser pen pointing at
          a contaminated drop of water is used. The beam passes through the
          drop, and you can see the shadows of the microorganisms living in the
          water on the wall, like a projector. The activity is designed to
          emphasize the importance of filtered water;
        </p>
        <h4>Petri Dish</h4>
        <p>
          The <i>Petri Dish</i> was the only in person activity, respecting all
          the sanitary criteria required by the context of the COVID-19
          pandemic. Petri dishes with complex medium were prepared, where each
          child left a handprint: one before washing and one after washing. The
          intention was, after two weeks, to compare the plates and show the
          microorganisms that grew there, emphasizing the importance of hand
          washing.
        </p>
        <h4>Coarse Salt Crystallization</h4>
        <p>
          The <i>Coarse Salt Crystallization</i> is an activity that seeks to
          understand supersaturated solutions. The solution, supersaturated with
          coarse salt, crystallizes at the bottom of a container after heating
          the water, forming crystal
        </p>
        <h4>CO2 Balloon</h4>
        <p>
          The <i>CO2 Balloon</i> activity uses the chemical reaction between
          vinegar (acetic acid)  and sodium bicarbonate inside a bottle with a
          balloon in the spout to produce CO2, and thus quickly fill the party
          bladder with the gas from reaction.
        </p>
        <h4>CinePalito</h4>
        <p>
          At <i>CinePalito</i>, the pedagogical theme was optical illusions. The
          children were given two pieces of paper, one with a picture of a cage
          and the other with blank space, and asked to draw a monster on the
          latter. Then the papers were glued with the drawings out, with a
          barbecue stick in the middle so that they could be rotated. By quickly
          rotating the pasted papers an optical illusion is created that joins
          the two images into one, creating the illusion of trapping the
          monster.
        </p>
        <h4>Ecological Bingo</h4>
        <p>
          <i>Ecological Bingo</i> was an activity created in partnership with
          "Estação Biologia" that uses a card with five ecosystems and five
          characteristics of each one: a general photo, an example of fauna, an
          example of flora, an abiotic characteristic and a problem
          environmental. The rows of photos are shuffled, and the children's
          goal is to relate the biomes to their respective characteristics,
          painting each photo with a corresponding color, similar to a bingo
          game.
        </p>
        <h4>Food Chain</h4>
        <p>
          In the <i>Food Chain</i> activity, children receive a personalized
          picture with various members of an ecosystem's food web: producers,
          primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. The children's goal is to
          trace as many food chains as possible, thus forming a complex food web
          with diverse trophic relationships. Note: this activity unfortunately
          could not be applied in the Scientific Camp of 2021.
        </p>
        <h4>Memory Game</h4>
        <p>
          The <i>Memory Game</i> was held on the Kahoot platform, with the
          intention of reminding children on the last day of the Camp of
          important moments in history and the contents worked during the weeks
          of application. The questions included concepts worked on in all
          previous activities: the Microbe Drop, Petri Dish, Coarse Salt
          Crystallization, CO2 Balloon, CinePalito and Ecological Bingo. related
          to pollination to be discovered. Each of them has a different style,
          with two figures representing bees and pollinators, respectively, one
          about the diversity of animal pollinators, a concrete challenge
          related to flowers and finally, a crossword with 10 words in
          Portuguese.

        <h2>Brazilian Synthetic Biology Olympiad</h2>

          During one of the Team’s earliest brainstorming sessions, we faced a
          complicated challenge. How to popularize synbio in Brazil? Many
          approaches were discussed until we found a common ground for the team
          members. Call it a coincidence or not, but we had all competed in
          several national and international science olympiads during High
          School, and we had fond memories of that time in our lives. Given that
          this kind of academic competition has grown extremely popular in our
          country for the past 20 years, we decided to profit from this familiar
          format for Brazilian students and create the first national synbio
          science olympiad.
        </p>

        <h3>Prospecting and Preparation</h3>

        <p>
          Everyone was excited about the project, but we had no idea how to make
          such a gigantic event possible. So, the first thing we did was to seek
          advice from former olympiad creators. We talked to the coordinators of
          <b>IYPT Brazil</b>, a practical physics competition, to understand
          whether there was any possibility to add experiments to our own.
          However, that seemed impractical due to the pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, we interviewed the coordinator of the
          <b>Brazilian Physics Olympiad</b> (Olimpíada Brasileira de Física -
          OBF), who helped us understand a little more about the logistics of
          putting up a paper-based national test. Even Though the format of that
          competition resembled a little more what we wanted to do, there was
          still something missing. Physics is a mandatory subject in Brazilian
          High School, but synthetic biology is not. How could we make a test on
          a subject no one has ever studied?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>João Canalle</b> was the one who helped us work that around.
          Professor Canalle did something very similar to what our Team aimed to
          do. He created the
          <b>Brazilian Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad</b>(OBA!) to
          popularize astronomy among Brazilian students. Just like synbio,
          astronomy is not taught in schools. Therefore, he had to come up with
          a way to overcome this barrier. His solution was to add as much
          information as he could in the texts of the questions, so the students
          could learn while taking the test! That was the solution we were
          looking for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nevertheless, there was still a major challenge to surpass. All those
          olympiads were paper-based and demanded a logistic effort the team
          could not afford to put into the competition. We mentioned that to
          professor Canalle, who then gave us the contact of a friend that he
          thought had all the answers to our problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s when we met <b>Daniel</b>. He, who’s also a professor, had
          created several different olympiads in the same informative style as
          professor Canalle. However, his tests had a little something extra:
          they were virtual. That not only solved the logistic issue but also
          opened up a world of possibilities regarding media format. That meant
          we could add authentic synbio material to our tests, including videos
          from iGEM TV and other teams’ wikis. **A year later Daniel would be
          invited to work for the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology
          and offer federal government support for our Team's olympiad.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that interview we had our plan: To make a virtual, informative,
          national olympiad in Brazil called
          <b>OBBS - Brazilian Synthetic Biology Olympiad!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Shortly after we contacted <b>Fractal</b>, a company specialized in
          digital learning that had created the platforms for Daniel’s
          olympiads. They were receptive to our idea and offered to partner with
          us through their non-profit branch <b>Instituto Vertere</b>.
          Nonetheless, they suggested we make a Pocket Olympiad, a short and
          thematic test to try out our model before moving to the grand national
          competition.

        <p>
          In the meantime, we contacted two professors from our university’s
          <b>Institute of Biology</b>, <b>Prof. Dra. Cris Arias</b> and
          <b>Prof. Dra. Maria Elice</b>, to help us understand the base for
          teaching biological concepts by investigation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This method’s principle comes from the idea of presenting the student
          a new concept together with a problem and asking them the correct
          hypothesis. The first questions were used as a “warm-up” and to
          introduce basic concepts, like cell, enzyme, protein, DNA, RNA and the
          central dogma of molecular biology for example; but in the following
          questions new concepts, using the basic ones as a foundation,  were
          presented, together with some logic and interpretative problems.
          Another powerful teaching tool we used was the creation of a
          “glossary” containing short descriptions of these new concepts and
          ideas, making it easier for students to find and consult these ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an example we would like to highlight the sixth and ninth questions
          of the first step of OBBS:
        </p>

        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img

            alt=""
          />
        </figure>

        <p>
          As it can be seen, first, transcription and translation were
          presented, and then, a more complex question, involving logic and
          problem-solving was given.
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>

        <p>
          After a year and a half of preparation, in June 2021, we launched the
          first-ever synbio olympiad in Brazil:
          <b>The Hacking Ecosystems Pocket Olympiad!</b> With
          <b>over 800 participants</b>, students from all over the country had
          their first contact with synbio and were hyped towards the official
          event. However, things weren’t as perfect as we had expected. Grades
          were low, and it seemed that almost about
          <b>3/8 of the students had abandoned the competition</b>. That
          prompted us to think that we might have gone too deep in synbio for
          the first-timers.
        </p>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img
            style="max-width:70% ; max-height:70%"

        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img

            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          That was a lesson we took seriously when preparing for the actual
          event. Brazil is a deeply unequal country when it comes to education.
          So, if we were to popularize synbio here, we had to level the students
          first.
        </p>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img
            style="max-width:70% ; max-height:70%"
            src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/e/ef/T--USP-Brazil--IGEM-USP--Education-%26-Comunication-Workflow.jpeg"
            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          In the light of the social and economic scenario Brazil faces, we
          tried to <b>shape the olympiad to be as accessible as possible</b> for
          people from as many backgrounds as possible. We started by making the
          first phase non-eliminatory, so even if a student did badly on it he
          or she would not be barred from the second one. Nonetheless, students
          had a week to complete each phase. That means that low-income kids
          would have time to borrow a parent's or a friend's phone, or use a
          public library to take the test, in case they didn't have a device of
          their own. Considering that each phase introduces the participants to
          increasingly complex concepts in synbio, it wouldn't be fair to keep
          the students from accessing half this info solely because of a bad
          grade.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second action was to <b>assume they had no basis in biology</b>.
          Therefore, even simple concepts, like cells and DNA were explained
          either in the question's text, in a glossary or through multimedia
          (videos, gifs, and pictures). Finally, we added
          <b>affirmative actions</b> on the olympiad's statute to guarantee that
          underrepresented communities, such as students from public schools,
          black and indigenous pupils would have their share on both the medals
          and in the special prize offered.
        </p>

        <p>
          Speaking of the special prize, as an ultimate award, the top 10
          students would be invited to a
          <b
            >scientific immersion in one of Latin America's most prestigious
            universities, The University of São Paulo.</b
          >
          In this one-week trip to a vibrant research and entrepreneurship
          environment in the city of São Paulo, we hope to inspire students to
          further their interests in synbio and, ultimately, pursue a career in
          one of its correlated areas. To secure the means to provide this
          award, we partnered with our
          <b>University's Dean of Culture and Extension</b> who gave us
          permission to use USP's logo, facilities and financial aid.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though the final stage of the olympiad is happening as the wiki
          is being written, the statistics for the first stage show more
          promising results.
          <b
            >Around 3000 people were interested in taking the test with only ONE
            week of advertisement</b
          >. Students were from <b>ALL 26 Brazilian states</b>. The most
          frequent grades were 12,13 and 14, which shows that
          <b
            >most of them could absorb a good deal of information in this
            test.</b
          >
          Nonetheless, <b>61% declared themselves as females</b>, which shows an
          interesting inversion in gender balance when compared to other areas
          in STEM.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Another highlight was the participation of some partner iGEM teams in
          the creation of questions of the first stage.Teams from UNILA, UBC
          British Columbia, CCU Taiwan, Leiden and UFRS - Osiris wrote the
          questions in English and we translated and adapted their content to
          better fit the olympiad. Needless to say that we are deeply thankful
          for their collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>Our olympiad was quite innovative in another aspect as well.</p>

        <p>
          More than a tool to popularize synthetic biology, we wanted OBBS to
          introduce its competitors to the vibrant Brazilian Synbio community.
          In order to achieve this goal, our team tried to keep a close
          relationship with our target public through Instagram, where we could
          share content and opportunities from other synbio pages.On our page we
          received a lot o positive feedback about the olympiad,
        </p>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img
            style="max-width:50% ; max-height:50%"

            alt=""
          />
        </figure>
        <p>
          but also a fair share of questions regarding the exercises
          resolutions. So, we decided to carry out a live streaming event in
          which we explained each one of the 20 questions, highlighting points
          to be cautious about in each one of them. The feedback we received was
          once again pretty rewarding. Every single person said that this sort
          of correction and streaming helped them to understand what they have
          got wrong, feeling an even stronger connection with the olympiad as a
          whole. As of today, October 14th, the video has been visualized by
          more than 300 people and we hope to do the same for the second stage
          of the olympiad.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Future Prospects</h3>

        <p>
          For next year, we hope to expand the olympiad both in Brazil and in
          other countries. OBBS was invited to be part of a
          <b
            >unified platform for scientific olympiads developed by the
            Brazilian Government</b
          >
          and therefore we expect it to increase the competition's visibility
          for the following editions. Nonetheless, some private school chains,
          like <b>Poliedro</b>, and the
          <b>Secretary of Education from Minas Gerais</b> agreed to share OBBS
          with their schools, which would also help make it more widely known.
          As for the world, <b>Team Korea High School</b> has already shown
          interest in creating a similar competition in Korea and we expect to
          get more teams on board with this idea.

        <h2>Spreading the word about Synbio</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Interview with Globo Mogi</li>
          <p>
            On 01/05/2021, we appeared on the biggest brazilian TV network
            <i>Rede Globo</i>. An interview, available on the website of the
            communications network, made it possible to present to the country
            the iGEM competition and a it of its history, talking about our
            synthetic biology project and our Human Practices work.

          <p>
            It was a very important event for us, because it gave us the chance
            to talk about science and synthetic biology at the biggest broadcast
            channel in Brazil, and you can check it

            SUPFAB (Which stands for Semana Universitária Paulista de Farmácia e
            Bioquímica, portuguese for São Paulo University Week of Pharmacy and
            Biochemistry) is one of the biggest events for undergraduate
            students in the area of pharmaceutical and biochemical sciences of
            not only USP, but also the whole state, so, having a presentation in
            this event was a great honour for our team.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, the event was hosted by the 55th time, and, due to the
            pandemic, it was hold online and counted with over 700 participants,
            with 280 of them attending to our presentation.

            After a brief presentation about the iGEM competition and the
            university's team we organized a “round-table” style talk with Pablo
            Cárdenas, an PhD researcher of MIT, born in Colombia, who works with
            controlling and studying the genome of
            <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and participated in iGEM. All of that
            background made him a nice fit to the discussion. topics like the
            situation of biological sciences in Latin America, synthetic biology
            as a tool for health sciences, the importance of university research
            programs and the importance of iGEM to the synbio community were hot
            topics discussed between Pablo, the team members and the attendeats,
            by chat.
