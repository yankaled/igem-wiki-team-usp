        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

        <p>
          During the Covid-19 pandemic, Brazil faced the uttermost consequences
          of <b>scientific illiteracy</b>. Fake news spread just like the virus,
          prompting people to abandon safety measures, refuse vaccination and
          self-medicate with dangerous and ineffective medication cocktails [1].
          Amidst the sanitary crises, our country saw
          <b>funding for science being systematically slashed</b> [2], and the
          <b>quality of public education worsened</b> due to the abrupt shift to
          online school [1].
        </p>

        <p>
          We asked ourselves, how can an educational project thrive in this
          catastrophic scenario, in which schools are closed and a generalized
          sense of disbelief in science lingers in the air. We came to a simple
          conclusion - <B>GO BIG OR GO HOME!</B>
        </p>

        <p>
          To face the gigantic challenges we encountered, a successful project
          not only had to be innovative enough to surpass all the limitations
          imposed by covid but also large enough to deeply impact society with
          synthetic biology's message. That was our goal when we created the
          Scientific Camp and the Brazilian Synthetic Biology Olympiad.
        </p>

        <h2>SCIENTIFIC CAMP</h2>

        <p>
          The first project targeted elementary school students from
          underprivileged communities. Our goal was to join several educational
          projects from our university in one <b>GAMIFIED METHOD</b> to get
          those children fascinated by science. However, it wasn't that simple.
          Schools were closed, how could we interact with them? That's when we
          decided to innovate and base the whole experience on an immersive
          WhatsApp RPG-like story. That way children could interact with no more
          than a phone and one of the most popular apps in Brazil.
        </p>

        <p>
          We planned <b>6 days of activities</b>, which were to have different
          experiments from different fields of science (chemistry, physics and
          biology). Since several of these workshops were fully developed for
          this project, we made a partnership with the NGO Alavanca, where we
          did a <b><i>School Reinforcement</i></b
          >, where Camp monitors were able to apply for the first time the
          activities later used at Public School Samuel Klabin,
          <b
            >improving the teaching techniques and management skills of the
            classroom</b
          >. Due to the scale of the project, we made a
          <b>partnership with the British_Columbia Team</b> and developed
          together with some workshops, bits of the story and some logistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          To our surprise, we even got the chance to meet them in person as the
          sanitary situation got better in the past few months. That helped us
          to top the whole virtual experience with some easy-to-do experiments
          to <b>reinforce their recently acquired love for science</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >The Scientific Camp brought the iGEM USP Synthetic Biology Team
            closer to the local community</b
          >. Everyone learned a lot from the project: while the children learned
          about diverse science subjects, going from ecology to chemical
          reactions (and also had loads of fun), the team members learned a big
          deal about how to deal with children, how important playful games are
          for education, and how to engage with the public.

        <h2>BRAZILIAN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY OLYMPIAD</h2>

        <p>
          Despite the success of this innovative and accessible methodology, it
          wouldn't fulfil our mission to popularize synbio in Brazil. Scientific
          Camp's target audience was too young to fully understand how
          revolutionary synbio could be. Teenagers, on the other hand, already
          have the critical thinking capabilities not only to understand but
          also to judge the impacts synbio could have on their lives and their
          communities. Moreover, their minds still bear the creativity and
          excitement that most adults lose under the weight of responsibility.
          Therefore, they were the perfect public to
          <b>cast the seeds of Synbio all across the country</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To accomplish such an ambitious goal, we decide to profit from a
          familiar format with an already developed community in Brazil -
          Academic Olympiads. By partnering with Instituto Vertere, a non-profit
          dedicated to the creation of such competitions, we were able to create
          an accessible competition designed to fit Brazilian reality. One
          example was the implementation of <b>affirmative actions</b> in order
          to secure the presence of black, indigenous and public school students
          among those selected for the final award.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Brazilian Synthetic Biology Olympiad is a fully virtual
          competition accessible to anyway who has access to a smartphone or
          computer. As we know not every student has such devices accessible at
          all times, each test has a 7 days deadline, so the student may borrow
          a phone from a relative or a friend, or maybe use a public library.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of the content used to formulate the questions is authentic, so
          students would have a realistic view of how far has synbio already
          gone. Nonetheless, many questions were formulated by partner iGEM
          teams or made reference to iGEM and synbio communities around the
          world to show <b> how big and united our community is </b>. They
          prompted the students to think not only about techniques but
          <b>ethics and safety</b> as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the biggest highlight is that all questions were informative
          in a way that students would actually
          <b
            >LEARN WHILE TAKING THE TEST, WITH NO NEED FOR pRIOR SYNBIO
            KNOWLEDGE</b
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Results were as great as expected. Firstly, we
          <b
            >secured support from MCTI, the highest science and technology
            governmental organism in our country</b
          >. Over <b>2200 students from all 26 Brazilian states</b> participated
          in the olympiad's first phase. <b>Grades were as high as 100%</b> and
          we saw an <b>excellent gender balance</b> as the ratio from males to
          females was roughly 40/60, in contrast to whats is observed in other
          STEM areas. Nevertheless, we were also able to gather over 650 of
          these students on our Instagram webpage, where
          <b
            >we developed a close relationship with them and started opening
            doors to other synbio communities</b
          >, such as iGEM Design League, Synbbio clubs and so on.
