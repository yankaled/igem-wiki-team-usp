          <h2>Heroes in Science</h2>
          <h3>What is it</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>#HeroisNaCiencia</b> was an campaign realized in social media
            by the team USP BR. This initiative consisted in inviting brazilian
            (and some international) researchers to share, trough short clips,
            how their research line where affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
            the actions taken to help the combat of the virus. The project also
            tries to show the impacts of the pandemic on the day-to-day life of
            the researchers, bringing them closer to society and humanizing
            science.

          />
          <h3>History:</h3>
          <p>
            It all started when members of the group, whom sympathized with the
            front-line professionals on the struggle against the coronavirus and
            that, noting the whidespread desinformation across the country,
            decided to contribute. With a team composed by 26 studants across
            many institutes (Biology (IB), biomedical sciences (ICB),
            pharmaceutical sciences (FCF), mathematics (IME) and Comunicantions
            and arts (ECA) it was possible contacting the researchers, gather
            reliable information and present them in a simpler way to society.
            Thus the
            <b> #HeroisNaCiencia </b>became one of the activities promoted by
            the team.

          <h2>OBBS</h2>
          <h3>The challenge</h3>
          <img src="@/assets/image41.jpg" />

          <p>
            During one of the Team’s earliest brainstorming sessions, we faced a
            complicated challenge.

            <b>How to make synbio known in Brazil? </b> <br /><br />
            Many approaches were discussed, until we found a common ground for
            the Team members. Call it a coincidence or not, but we had all
            competed in several national and international academic olympiads
            during High School, and had fond memories of that time in our lives.
            Given that our team members come from all over the country, we
            started thinking that
            <b
              >the creation of a national Synbio academic olympiad could be the
              solution to how to popularize synthetic biology in our country.</b
            >
          </p>
          <img src="@/assets/Group15.jpg " />

          <p>
            Everyone was excited with the ideia, but we had no idea on how to
            make such a gigantic event possible. So, the first thing we did was
            to seek advice for former olympiad creators.
          </p>
          <h3>Learning from Experts</h3>
          <p>
            We talked to the coordinators of IYPT Brazil, a practical physics
            competition, to see if there was any possibility to add experiments
            to our own. However, that seemed impractical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, we interviewed the coordinator of the Brazilian Physics
            Olympiad (OBF), who helped us understand a little more about the
            logistics of putting up a paper based national test. Even Though the
            format of that competition resembled a little more what we wanted to
            do, there was still something missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Physics is a mandatory subject in Brazilian High School, but
            synthetic biology is not.
            <b
              >How could we make a test on a subject no one has ever studied?</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            João Canalle was the one who helped us work around that. Professor
            Canalle did something very similar to what the team aimed to do.
          </p>
          <img src="@/assets/Group-14.jpg" alt="" />

          <p>
            He created the Brazilian Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad to
            popularize astronomy amog Brazilian students. Just like synbio,
            astronomy isn’t taught in schools. Therefore, he had to come up with
            a way to overcome this barrier.
            <b
              >His solution was to add as much information as he could in the
              questions texts, so the students could learn while taking the
              test.</b
            >
            That was the solution we were looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, there was still a major challenge to surpass. All
            those olympiads were paper based and demanded a logistic effort the
            team couldn’t afford to put in the competition. We mentioned that to
            professor Canalle, who then gave us the contact of a friend that he
            thought had all the answers to our problems.
          </p>
          <img src="@/assets/Group-14.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            That’s when we met <b>Daniel</b>. He, who’s also a professor, had
            created several different olympiads in the same informative style as
            professor Canalle. However,
            <b>his tests had a little something extra: they were virtual.</b>
            That not only solved the logistic issue but also opened up a world
            of possibilities regarding media format. That meant we could add
            authentic synbio material to our tests, including videos from iGEM
            TV and other team’s wikis.
          </p>
          <h3>Ideate and design the Olympiads</h3>
          <p>
            After that interview we had our plan: To make a virtual,
            informative, national olympiad in Brazil called:<br /><br />
            <b>OBBS - Brazilian Synthetic Biology Olympiad!</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Shortly after we connected Fractal, a company specialized in digital
            learning that had created the platforms for Daniel’s olympiads. They
            were receptive to our idea and offered to partner with us through
            their non-profit branch Instituto Vertere. Nonetheless, they
            suggested we make a Pocket Olympiad to test our model before moving
            to the grand national competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, we contacted two professors from our university’s
            Institute of Biology to help us understand the base for teaching
            biological concepts by investigation
          </p>
          <h3>Launch the MVP</h3>
          <p>
            After months of preparation, In Jun 2021,
            <b
              >we launched the first ever synbio academic olympiad in Brazil:
              The Hacking Ecosystems Pocket Olympiad!</b
            >
