        <h2>BUSINESS PLAN</h2>
        <p>
          In search of knowledge on how to seek and apply the future of our
          project, we spoke with several professionals in the field. We got a
          partnership with BioLambda, a biotechnology company, in which its CEO
          became one of our main consultants in the area of entrepreneurship,
          teaching us about the mechanisms of company planning, prospecting and
          flexibility. We also got another key advisor within the innovation
          consulting firm Emerge, where Lucas Delgado told us more about the
          business model and regulations for prioritizing the project. Finally,
          we contacted BioMinas, an entrepreneurship company in biotechnology
          and life sciences, requesting a partnership. We got an offer of full
          scholarships in a course on entrepreneurship. This was essential to
          have a better foundation and direction in the creation of the business
          plan and professional development of our team
        </p>
        <p>
          From that, we were able to assemble a business plan that was divided
          into two main propositions: commercial area and academic area. In the
          commercial area, the project would be developed to be associated with
          a company or start a startup of its own. Throughout our trajectory,
          several conversations with the Brazilian Agricultural Research
          Corporation, in which we have an important interest in embracing our
          project. In the academic area, the project would be developed and
          written with the aim of publishing articles, enabling the opening to
          new fields of research, with the help of sponsorship from
          stakeholders.
        </p>
        <h2>P&G PARTNERSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of 2021 the opportunity arose to establish a
          partnership with P&G (Procter & Gamble, American consumer goods giant)
          thanks to one of the team members, Luiz Lima: he contacted an
          acquaintance who works at the company in order to start a among many
          of our science outreach projects - the P&G Roundtables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, as the demands of the Scientific and the National Synthetic
          Biology Olympiad became heavier, Luiz passed the torch to João Honda,
          who took over the contacts with P&G representatives, the prospection
          of potential speakers and, also, the sponsorship agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what is the reason behind this endeavor? In addition to getting
          sponsorship to add to our funds and leverage the team's research, we
          remain faithful to our commitment to disseminate knowledge to society
          in a broad manner and in an accessible format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the core of the structure of this event was built around
          a "tripod": we seek to dialogue between the vertices of the Academy
          (with the authority in the area covered having been chosen by us) and
          the Market (whose spokesperson would be chosen by P&G) , with the Team
          iGEM USP at the other end, incorporating in itself the role of
          mediator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it was agreed that we would discuss, at the round tables,
          the following topics: "diversity" (of sexual orientation, gender and
          ethnicity), "The Mindset of Innovation" (taking scientific research
          from the perspective of Brazilian entrepreneurship) and, Last but not
          least, "Why be yourself in the workforce?" (an approach more linked to
          human resources, but which is undoubtedly relevant to all areas,
          especially those who aim to enter the labor market for the first
          time).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, we have the distinguished presence of: Lucy Souza, science
          communicator at Make Science BR and trans activist; Palloma Batista,
          LGBTQ+ activist for P"&"G; Beatriz Pacheco from Ginkgo Bioworks;
          Caetano Sabino da Biolambda; Abílio Francisco, Marketing Manager at
          Always; and Sueli Campos, current Human Resources director at SGS
          Brasil.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth remembering that, always striving for the accessibility of
          our content, we broadcast the tables live through our social networks
          - Facebook and Instagram - in addition to having posted them on our
          YouTube channel, in order to record this fun, educating experience and
          captivating.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, more than an enriching partnership with a colossal player,
          we have the presence of several distinguished authorities from their
          respective areas to provide conversations that are both relaxed and
          informative to the most diverse spectators, even if the focus was
          initially on the university audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to be a first step toward a long-term partnership with
          P&G, as well as a test of our audience reach. Given the very positive
          feedbacks from our broadcasts and the effervescent engagement of users
          in them, there's no doubt: we delivered everything we expected and
          much more.
        </p>
        <h2>COMMERCE AND MEDIA</h2>
        <p>
          Within the project's business plan, we thought we would need ways to
          make the project better known and facilitate the search for new
          prospects. Having said that, we created a plan for the creation of an
          official website for the iGEM-USP Brazil team, as well as a
          reformulation and rebirth of our YouTube channel, both serving as
          services that maintain and act beyond the current project. The
          official website
          <a href="https://igemusp.com/">https://igemusp.com/ </a>contains all
          the description of our project, previous projects, the team, as well
          as pages for donations and for contacting the team. In it, we also
          applied our own store building plan. This store would have the
          objective of maintaining the team as a whole, as well as sustaining
          the economic future of the Let.It.Bee project post-competition.
          Therefore, we built a document with all the operation and rules of the
          store, and signed a business partnership with the jewelry company
          Pérolla, in which part of the sales profits obtained with the coupon
          associated with our project would be converted to the team, as well as
          a partnership with Vivian de Sordi, creator of handcrafted and
          original jewelry. We got a deal on two sets of 100% original jewelry
          inspired by our current project made by Vivian.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rebirth of our YouTube channel has allowed us to become a center
          for the dissemination of our projects and as a means of scientific
          dissemination, with materials prepared by our audiovisual team, with
          the objective of reaching an ever-wider audience.
