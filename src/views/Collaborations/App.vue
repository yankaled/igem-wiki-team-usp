          One of the many great aspects of iGEM is access to a global network.
          Meeting different people, with individual histories, cultures and ways
          of thinking. Each different person can bring a unique view about a
          project and an opinion on how to approach the issues we found along
          the way. These different approaches encourage us to find the most
          collaborations we possibly can take. A very special one was the
          collaboration of many teams around the world by writing great
          questions about synthetic biology for our Synbio Olympiad in Brazil!
        </p>
        <span id="Trans"></span>
        <p>These were the Collaborations projects we were part of:</p>

        <h2>Translation of Children’s Book</h2>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">
          <img

          />
        </figure>
        <h3>CCU_Taiwan</h3>

        <p>
          We collaborated with the CCU_Taiwan team by translating their
          children's book "The War on Germs" to Portuguese. This book tells the
          story of a battle between a little boys body defense and a a army of
          bacteria that infected his would. More than just an exciting story,
          the book also shares a little of Taiwanese culture and CCU's iGEM
          project with the public. In retribution, their team elaborated
          questions to our Synthetic Biology Olympiad.<span id="Dry"></span>
        </p>

        <h2>Collaboration on adapting data for drylab</h2>
        <figure class="has-text-centered">

          />
        </figure>
        <h3>UZurich</h3>

        <p>
          We collaborated with the UZurich team with some orientations about
          their drylab project. They contacted us through Instagram, by their
          advisor, Cauã Westmann. In return, they wrote some questions for our
          Synthetic Biology Olympiad.

          />
        </figure>
        <h3>Korea_HS</h3>

        <p>
          We collaborated with Korea_HS team by giving them some orientations
          about their dry lab project and some tips on how to improve their
          presentations. We have also sent a picture and description of our team
          for them to advertise synbio. In return, they wrote some questions for
          our Synthetic Biology Olympiad, which they were interested in adapting
          for a Korean edition the following year.<span id="Finance"></span>
        </p>

        <h2>Collaboration on advice about financing the project</h2>

        </figure>
        <h3>UNILA_LatAm</h3>

        <p>
          We collaborated with the UNILA_LatAm team with some orientations about
          revenues and some way of getting funds in Brazil, such as raffles. In
          return, they wrote questions for our Synthetic Biology Olympiad.<span

        </p>

        <h2>Collaboration on social media projects</h2>

          />
        </figure>
        <h3>Saint_Joseph</h3>

        <p>
          We collaborated with the Saint_Joseph team by sending them a short
          video about our team and describing a bit of our project, so they
          could advertise synbio projects.

        </figure>
        <h3>Aix-Marseille</h3>

        <p>
          Aix-Marseille reached out to us on our Instagram account calling us to
          participate in a small game in their account where we would send them
          an emoji and a tips so their followers could guess our project's name.

        <h2>One-sided Collaborations</h2>

        <h3>Rio_UFRJ_Brazil</h3>

        <p>
          Even though we were not able to have a two-way exchange, team
          Rio_UFRJ_Brazil sent us some questions to use in our Olympiad.
        </p>

          />
        </figure>

        <h3>FCB-UANL</h3>

        <p>
          We reached out FCB-UANL to get some advice on entrepreneurship, based
          on their successful project last year. Even though we were competing
          on Twitter over the GenScript sponsorship, they were kind enough to
          help us understand a bit more about entrepreneurship. The return
          project was to write a children's book, but we were not able to
          deliver it in time.

        </figure>

        <h3>Leiden</h3>

        <p>
          Leiden helped us multiple times. Even though we were not able to do
          something about their project, they were solicitous to give us some
          advice on how to do a proper wiki, also write some questions for our
          olympiad.
